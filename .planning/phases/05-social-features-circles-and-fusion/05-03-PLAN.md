<objective>
Shared Gallery and Consent Backend -- ArtworkConsent model, shared gallery API showing all active members' iris art, plus consent service enabling explicit approval before art is used in fusion or compositions.

Purpose: Enable collaborative art viewing (SOCL-03) and establish the consent foundation (SOCL-06) required before fusion features. Backend must exist before mobile gallery can be built.
Output: ArtworkConsent model, consent API, shared gallery endpoint, Alembic migration.

    **ArtworkConsent Model** (`backend/app/models/artwork_consent.py`):
    - id: UUID PK (default uuid4)
    - artwork_id: UUID FK to photos.id ON DELETE CASCADE, indexed
    - grantor_user_id: UUID FK to users.id ON DELETE CASCADE, indexed (the artwork owner who grants/denies)
    - grantee_user_id: UUID FK to users.id ON DELETE CASCADE, indexed (the person requesting to use the art)
    - circle_id: UUID FK to circles.id ON DELETE CASCADE, nullable (scoped to circle context)
    - purpose: String, not null -- "fusion" or "composition"
    - status: String, default "pending" -- "pending", "granted", "denied", "revoked"
    - requested_at: DateTime(timezone=True), server_default now
    - decided_at: DateTime(timezone=True), nullable
    - Relationships: artwork (Photo), grantor (User, foreign_keys=[grantor_user_id]), grantee (User, foreign_keys=[grantee_user_id]), circle (Circle, nullable)
    - UniqueConstraint("artwork_id", "grantee_user_id", "purpose", name="uq_consent_artwork_grantee_purpose") -- one consent per artwork+grantee+purpose combination

    Update `backend/app/models/__init__.py`: Import ArtworkConsent.
    Update `backend/app/models/user.py`: Add relationships for consent_grants and consent_requests.

    **Schemas** (`backend/app/schemas/consent.py`):
    - ConsentRequestCreate: artwork_ids (List[UUID], min 1, max 10), purpose (str, "fusion" or "composition"), circle_id (Optional[UUID]).
    - ConsentResponse: id, artwork_id, grantor_user_id, grantee_user_id, purpose, status, requested_at, decided_at.
    - ConsentDecision: status (str, "granted" or "denied").
    - PendingConsentResponse: id, artwork_id, artwork_preview_url, grantee_email, purpose, circle_name, requested_at.

    **Migration:**
    Generate Alembic migration creating `artwork_consents` table with the unique constraint and all indexes.
  </action>
  <verify>
    Run: `cd /home/jbellot/Documents/repo/iris-art/backend && python -c "from app.models.artwork_consent import ArtworkConsent; print('ArtworkConsent OK')"`
    Verify migration file exists in alembic/versions/.
  </verify>
  <done>
    ArtworkConsent model exists with per-artwork, per-grantee, per-purpose tracking. Schemas define request/response shapes. Migration creates artwork_consents table with indexes and unique constraint.

    **Consent Service** (`backend/app/services/consent_service.py`):
    - `request_consent(artwork_ids, requester_id, purpose, circle_id, db)`:
      For each artwork: get photo, skip if requester owns it (self-consent implicit), check for existing granted consent (skip if already granted), check for existing pending consent (skip if pending), create new ArtworkConsent with status="pending". Return list of created consent requests.
    - `grant_consent(consent_id, grantor_id, db)`: Verify grantor owns the artwork. Set status="granted", decided_at=now(). Return updated consent.
    - `deny_consent(consent_id, grantor_id, db)`: Verify grantor owns the artwork. Set status="denied", decided_at=now().
    - `revoke_consent(consent_id, grantor_id, db)`: Only revoke if status="granted". Set status="revoked", decided_at=now().
    - `check_all_consents_granted(artwork_ids, requester_id, purpose, db)`: For each artwork not owned by requester, check that a consent with status="granted" exists. Return bool.
    - `get_pending_consents_for_user(user_id, db)`: Get all consents where grantor_user_id=user_id and status="pending". Include artwork preview URL (presigned). Return list of PendingConsentResponse.
    - `get_consent_status(artwork_ids, requester_id, purpose, db)`: For each artwork, return consent status (self, granted, pending, denied, none). Used by mobile to show consent state per artwork.

    **Shared Gallery** -- extend `backend/app/services/circle_service.py`:
    - `get_shared_gallery(circle_id, user_id, db, offset=0, limit=20)`:
      Verify active membership. Get all active member user_ids (left_at IS NULL). Query photos where user_id IN member_ids AND upload_status="processed", ordered by created_at DESC. Include style jobs (completed status) for each photo. Paginate with offset/limit. For each photo, generate presigned URL for thumbnail. Return list with owner info (user_id, email).

    **API Routes:**

    Extend `backend/app/api/routes/circles.py` -- add shared gallery endpoint:
    - `GET /api/v1/circles/{circle_id}/gallery?offset=0&limit=20` -- Shared gallery. Returns paginated list of member artworks with presigned thumbnail URLs and owner info.

    Create `backend/app/api/routes/consent.py`:
    - `POST /api/v1/consent/request` -- Request consent for artwork usage. Body: ConsentRequestCreate. Returns list of ConsentResponse (created consents) + list of already-granted artwork_ids.
    - `GET /api/v1/consent/pending` -- List pending consent requests for current user (as grantor). Returns List[PendingConsentResponse].
    - `POST /api/v1/consent/{consent_id}/decide` -- Grant or deny. Body: ConsentDecision. Returns ConsentResponse.
    - `POST /api/v1/consent/{consent_id}/revoke` -- Revoke granted consent. Returns ConsentResponse.
    - `GET /api/v1/consent/status?artwork_ids=...&purpose=fusion` -- Check consent status for multiple artworks. Returns dict of {artwork_id: status}.

    Register consent router in `backend/app/main.py`.
  </action>
  <verify>
    Run: `cd /home/jbellot/Documents/repo/iris-art/backend && python -c "from app.api.routes.consent import router; print('Consent router OK')"`
    Run: `cd /home/jbellot/Documents/repo/iris-art/backend && python -c "from app.services.consent_service import request_consent, check_all_consents_granted; print('Consent service OK')"`
    Verify shared gallery route exists: `grep "gallery" backend/app/api/routes/circles.py`
  </verify>
  <done>
    Consent service handles full lifecycle (request, grant, deny, revoke, check). Shared gallery endpoint returns paginated cross-member artwork with presigned URLs. Consent API registered in main.py. Self-owned artwork skips consent (implicit).
  </done>
